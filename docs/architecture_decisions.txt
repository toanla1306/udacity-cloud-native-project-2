Frontend Client:
Still use API Restful, with protocol HTTP ïƒ  Because client can use in any browser to access frontend
Connection Route:
Because Connection Route is called by Frontend client so that I will still use API Restful, protocol HTTP to communicate with frontend client easiest than gRPC and Kafka.
Person Route:
Because Connection Route is called by Frontend client so that I will still use API Restful, protocol HTTP to communicate with frontend client easiest gRPC and Kafka.
Location Route:
I will change type message passing in that route to gRPC with protocol buffer and Kafka with protocol TCP
Because I think Location Route not be called in any client frontend, therefore I can easy to change message passing. Another I think when tracking location of user, we will face with streaming data.
